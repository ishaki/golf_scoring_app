# History "View Details" - Navigation to Dashboard

## Problem
When users clicked "View Details" on the History page, a modal popup showed a basic scorecard table. Users expected to see the full Dashboard with all tabs (Leaderboard, Hole Breakdown, Transactions, Summary).

## Solution
Changed "View Details" to:
1. Load the selected game into the game store
2. Navigate to the Dashboard page
3. Show the full dashboard experience

## What Changed

### File: `src/pages/History.jsx`

**Before**:
```javascript
const handleViewGame = async (gameId) => {
  const game = await loadGameById(gameId);
  setSelectedGame(game);  // Show modal
};
```

**After**:
```javascript
const handleViewGame = async (gameId) => {
  const game = await loadGameById(gameId);
  if (game) {
    // Load game into store and navigate to dashboard
    useGameStore.setState({ game });
    navigate('/dashboard');
  }
};
```

### Removed:
- ❌ `selectedGame` state variable
- ❌ Modal popup UI (lines 147-206)
- ❌ Scorecard table in modal

### Added:
- ✅ Direct navigation to Dashboard
- ✅ Load game into global store

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:

1. **User goes to History page** (`/history`)
2. **Sees list of completed games** with player names, scores, winner
3. **Clicks "View Details"** on a game
4. **Game loads into store** via `useGameStore.setState({ game })`
5. **Navigates to Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
6. **Full Dashboard displays** with all tabs:
   - 🏆 Leaderboard
   - 📊 Hole Breakdown
   - 💱 Transactions
   - 📋 Summary
7. **User can Share** the game (if completed)
8. **User can view all details** using the tab navigation
