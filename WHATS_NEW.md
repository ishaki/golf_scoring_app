## ✨ Resume Game Feature

### 🎯 Never Lose Your Game Again!

Your golf game now auto-saves to the cloud after every score entry. If you accidentally close your browser or your device dies, you can pick up exactly where you left off!

### How It Works

#### 🏠 **Home Page** - Game In Progress Banner
When you have an active game, the home page shows a prominent orange banner:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🕐 Game In Progress                     │
│                                         │
│ Course: Standard Par 72                 │
│ Players: John & Mike                    │
│ Current Hole: 7 of 18                   │
│                                         │
│  [▶ Resume Game]                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### ⚠️ **Setup Page** - Warning Modal
Try to start a new game while one is active? You'll see:
```
